# Homework #04 - Kaomoji Texting

## description

Create a site that takes a text message and replaces the words representing emotions with kaomoji!
(ପ૮๑ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ๑ აଓ)
E.g. "Today's weather is nice and it makes me happy" -> "Today's weather is nice and it makes me ♥(ˆ⌣ˆԅ)"

Additionally, users will be able to manage the mapping of words with kaomoji through the manipulation of an in-memory data store.

There will be 2 pages:

`root` - `/:` root path that redirects to the `/editor` page.

`editor` - `/editor`: editor page with text editor that adds a corresponding kaomoji to the text.

`dictionary` - `/dictionary`: page that shows the list of all available kaomojis and their corresponding emotions.
